📅 Example Use Cases

   onboarding_assistant: auto-welcome new-hires with context from docs, boards, Teams.
   
   release_note_builder: summarize Jira/commits → post to GitLab + Slack.
   
   calendar_checker: suggest optimal team meeting times.
   
   incident_responder: summarize incident logs and notify team.
   
   persona_simulator: rewrite Jira tickets in different voices.

🔒 Secure by Design

   PII/PHI-safety in agents via team reactions and profiles.
   
   API keys stored via environment variables.
   
   Minimal external data storage — cache + summarize if needed.
